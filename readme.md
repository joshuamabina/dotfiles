# My dotfiles

I maintain this repo slowly, mainly to support my Vim development workflow.

Posting an issue works, but emailing me at mabinajoshua@gmail.com will usually get a faster response.

Optimized for Ubuntu 22.04 and tailored for:

- Dart and Flutter
- Laravel-PHP development
- React
- Python development

For setup instructions, see [docs.md](./docs/docs.md). For ideas, todos, and the product roadmap, check [todos.md](./docs/todos.md).

## Inspiration

- [Vim and Python: A Match Made in Heaven](https://realpython.com/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven)

## Server setup

If you use Vim on the server, you might want to check:

- basic.vimrc
- basic.zshrc
- basic.essentials *includes install scripts for essentials i.e. tree, git, ack*

## Installing and adding a Vim plugin

1. Clone the plugin GitHub repo as a git submodule, `git submodule add --depth=1 [plugin-git-url] [_vim/pack/plugins/start/]`

2. Stage, commit, and push changes for review and merging.
