# My Dotfiles

I maintain this repo slowly, mainly to support my Vim development workflow.
rarely open it. Posting an issue works, but emailing me at mabinajoshua@gmail.com will usually get a faster response.

Optimized for Ubuntu 22.04 and tailored for:

- Dart and Flutter

- Laravel-PHP development

- React

- React Native with Expo

- Python development

For setup instructions, see [docs.md](./docs/docs.md). For ideas, todos, and the product roadmap, check [todos.md](./docs/todos.md).

## Server Setup

- **Vim and basic.vimrc**

- **ohmyzsh and basic.zshrc**

- **Essentials** (e.g., tree, git, ack)

## Known Issues

  There are a few known issues already, but if you find something new, feel free to share it.

  - Clipboard issues.

  - The `manpath` complains: Can't set the locale; ensure `$LC_*` and `$LANG` are correct.
