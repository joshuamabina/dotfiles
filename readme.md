# My dotfiles

Optimized for Ubuntu 22.04

My goal is to fine-tune these configurations for seamless setup and execution within seconds. Specifically tailored for the following use cases and platforms:

- Laravel-PHP code development
- Flutter code writing and testing on Android
- React-Redux code creation for the web
- React Native (Expo) for mobile app development
- Python code and library writing

Some gotchas:

- This project is trying to keep things lean, so we've opted for Vim 8's native package manager.
- This repo uses git submodules to manage dependencies. So, don't forget to run `git submodule update`.

To kick things off, take a look at the docs.md file!
