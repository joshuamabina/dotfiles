# My dotfiles

Currently optimized for Ubuntu 22.04 (also, plans exists for Debian).

My goal is to fine-tune these configurations for seamless setup and execution within seconds. Specifically tailored for the following use cases and platforms:

- **WIP:HighPriority** React-Redux-Jest code creation for the web
- Laravel-PHP code development
- Flutter code writing and testing on Android
- React Native (Expo) for mobile app development
- Python code and library writing

TODO: Create a roadmap table to describe the implementation of the above, also marking their priorities and date to completion.

Some gotchas:

- This project is trying to keep things lean, so we've opted for Vim 8's native package manager.
- This repo uses git submodules to manage dependencies. So, don't forget to run `git submodule update`.

To kick things off, take a look at the [docs.md](./docs.md) file!
